V.0.0.1
It's a glorified countdown timer currently.
Using hooks, I've managed to make a pretty simple countdown timer. In time, I'm hoping to 
actually make this a useful webapp. Buuut that's well away. Small, incremental steps for now.

Next Steps:
*Set timer to use minutes instead of seconds.
*Keep track of time meditated, most likely will need to start building a backend
*User Authentication
*Gamification elements that actually make this a worthwhile meditation app.
