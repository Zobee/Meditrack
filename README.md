V.0.0.1
It's a glorified countdown timer currently.
Using hooks, I've managed to make a pretty simple countdown timer. In time, I'm hoping to 
actually make this a useful webapp. Buuut that's well away. Small, incremental steps for now.

Next Steps:
*Set timer to use minutes instead of seconds.
*Keep track of time meditated, most likely will need to start building a backend
*User Authentication
*Gamification elements that actually make this a worthwhile meditation app.

V.0.0.2

New Feature: ...minutes

Got the minutes working! It took a minute to actually get the progress bar moving, but I'm glad I got it. The display should count down the minutes and seconds, and accurately display them in the middle radial thing. Next phase is the time management. Doesn't seem too hard after that.
